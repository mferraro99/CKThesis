This repository contains the codes from my M. Sc. thesis in Chemical Engineering in Politecnico di Milano (a.y. 2022-2023).

The codes are developed in the context of the program EStokTP, developed by Prof. Carlo Cavallotti (Dep. CMIC Giulio Natta, Politecnico di Milano).

1) InChI2data: code for the preparation of input file data for EStokTP for single and multiple jobs

2) FragsGen: code for the generation of fragmentation products, starting from a InChI identifier (for AVTST application)

3) ???: code for the estimation of thermochemical parameters (cp, S, H and G) in the form of CHEMKIN NASA polynomials, using a CBH approach for H estimation @ 0 K
